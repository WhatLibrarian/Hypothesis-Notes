## Page Notes
Joseph Esposity "[Libraries Face a Future of Open Access](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/05/23/libraries-face-future-open-access/)" published by *[The Scholarly Kitchen*](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/) on May 23, 2018.  Pull quote: "What appears to get lost in discussions of the march of cancelled contracts in Europe is that it is not just publishers that are being disrupted. This is a disruption to the entire ecosystem. When the favor comes due, we may not like the terms, but pay we will."
