    - Annotation: Great point Nick, BC Campus has created [a toolkit for student advocacy](https://opentextbc.ca/studenttoolkit/) and Inside Higher Ed published this [article about the role of students in OER](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/views/2017/12/13/students-have-vital-role-creating-and-spreading-oer). And of course students themselves are advocating on the own behalf with [PIRG](https://studentpirgs.org/campaigns/make-textbooks-affordable/) . As for general education - for me, it involves modeling (I'm using Libre Office and publishing with platforms that support Open and here's why) and continual education at the point-of-need. I think this also speaks to Digital Literacies directly. What tools are we choosing to use and why?

    - Annotation: Agree. I skip the legal stuff and usually stick to what will reduce obstacles to students being successful.

    - Annotation: Yes, an OER license explicitely retains the copyright to the author BUT allows others to reuse, redistribute, revise the material.  In the pubic domain there is no retention of author rights. Well discuss more during Session 2.  Bring your questions.

    - Annotation: Yes, my understanding is then when the new ctcLink system kicks in our courses will be able to be marked either OER ($0) or Low-cost (this is in the works).

    - Annotation: Policy 188 covers accessibility.  The OER designation will probably just reflect cost.

    - Annotation: Melanie, there was a video released yesturday that was a discusion about the invisible labor around OER>   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL9Ep56IFH0).  "OER work is hard work—and valuable work—but it is too often undervalued, under-compensated, and hidden from sight. The notion of doing OER “stuff” on the side, in addition to a heavy load of formal duties, is all too familiar, and the emotional investment from many of us is considerable."

    - Annotation: No mandates (which I would never support) but there will be an OER designation on courses coming soon with the implementation of the ctc link (as per my current understanding).

    - Annotation: Hi Pam - the SBCTC has just rolled out some new accessibility training modules.  You can [register here](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.sbctc.edu%2fcolleges-staff%2fprograms-services%2feducational-technology-open-education%2ftraining-registration.aspx&c=E,1,fvqTg02rZRDhgWO9QRLWzdTFZcOPRaeWYgnqOG3HJUvY-l09-2GGVpxLsupeLNdIUU6-_wjnEAx7ABYg8SxIPU2FwLvau9Zv1kigNQr4dGzMlaiQoSAeLsihhQ,,&typo=1).  I believe HR is working to stremline or codify the onboarding process so that new instructors do get that training.
