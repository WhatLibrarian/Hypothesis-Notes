## Page Notes
## Highlights
- The Tragedy of the Commons by Boundless & Lumen Learning — [Updated on 2018-09-21 13:53:26](https://hyp.is/Ywym_L3gEeie-bs-trR2rA/certificates.creativecommons.org/cccerteducomments/chapter/additional-resources/) — Group: #Public

    - Annotation: The link to this text is broken. Boundless has gone out of business.  I would suggest as a replacement [the Wikipedia article on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). It is a B-class article and is organized in a logical fashion.
- Free Culture Game by Molle Industria. CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 A game to help understand the concept of free culture http://www.molleindustria.org/en/freeculturegame/ — [Updated on 2018-09-21 13:56:39](https://hyp.is/xkXR5L3gEeiOTANjQ8UU7w/certificates.creativecommons.org/cccerteducomments/chapter/additional-resources/) — Group: #Public

    - Annotation: This should probably not be 3 different bullet points as it is all one resource.  Also, quick question, how does this illustrate 'other' open movements as it seems to be about what free culture is.
- More information about other open movements — [Updated on 2018-09-24 09:05:03](https://hyp.is/mOKXAsATEeiM-tNyiPZ2rg/certificates.creativecommons.org/cccerteducomments/chapter/additional-resources/) — Group: #Public

    - Annotation: [OER Africa](https://www.oerafrica.org/) is an OER organization that promotes resources and professional development and is a solid example of OER in the global south.
